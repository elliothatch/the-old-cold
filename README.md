The Old Cold
============

By Elliot Hatch

Make in 24 hours for [Fresh4Less Winter Jam 2015](http://fresh4less.org/winter-jam-2015/).

The Evil Wiz Kid is at it again! On your way to receive your award from the Distinguished 
Wiz Guild a terrible blizzzzard rolled your way. You found shelter in an abandoned blue square,
but you've been *snowed in*, and the Wiz Kids knows your greatest nightmare--angry clones.

You need to find the Wiz Kid and give him what-for. But you can't seem to find him.

Don't lose yourself.

Beware the Old Cold.
